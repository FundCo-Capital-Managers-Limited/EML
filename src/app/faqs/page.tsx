const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is a MiniGrid?",
    a: "A MiniGrid is a localized power system serving a small community or an area not connected to the main electrical grid, often using renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or hydro.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the key steps in MiniGrid design?",
    a: "Define geographic scope, assess commercial viability of a community based on predetermined criteria for a minigrid, assess available resources, size the system, select the configuration, and design the distribution system.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the phases of a MiniGrid project lifecycle?",
    a: "The phases include community consultation and system planning & design, construction, operation & maintenance, and end use of electricity for residential and productive users.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the technical components of a MiniGrid?",
    a: "Basic components are grouped into Production, Distribution, and End-User systems, including energy storage like lithium-ion batteries, distribution lines, and metering systems.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do MiniGrids benefit rural electrification?",
    a: "MiniGrids can provide reliable, affordable electricity in remote areas, promote productive use of energy (PUE), and reduce carbon emissions by leveraging renewable resources.",
  },
  {
    q: "What challenges are associated with MiniGrid implementation?",
    a: "Challenges include lack of sustainable maintenance, insufficient primary energy resources, high upfront costs, regulatory issues, and cultural or economic factors affecting adoption.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does financing work for MiniGrid projects?",
    a: "Financing can involve grants, subsidies, public-private partnerships, or private investment. The financial structure often includes considerations for high initial costs and long-term sustainability.",
  },
  {
    q: "What types of MiniGrid models exist?",
    a: "Models include utility, private, community, and public-private partnership models.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the performance of MiniGrids monitored?",
    a: "Performance monitoring involves tracking energy generation, system health, consumer usage and consumer revenue collections, often through online real-time remote monitoring systems and/or on-site checks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can MiniGrids be integrated with the national grid?",
    a: "Yes, MiniGrids can be designed with the flexibility to integrate with the national grid when it extends to their area, often requiring technical upgrades to match grid standards.",
  },
